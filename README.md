# Architectural-Demos
This is a starter project in Unity to create an architectural demo that can viewed through an oculus rift.

My aim is to set up a basic Oculus type camera and implement some simple controls.
This should allow the user to fly or perhaps walk (if I get gravity working) around a demonstration architectural property.
